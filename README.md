# VidBits
Project for TDD course from CodeAcademy

In this project, you will put your knowledge of outside-in test-driven development to the test by building a full-stack JavaScript web application.

The final version of the web application will have three pages:

* A landing page that displays all of the videos with their title
* A page for adding a new video with title and description
* A page for viewing, updating, and deleting existing videos
